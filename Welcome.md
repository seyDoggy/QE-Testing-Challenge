Good afternoon <CANDIDATE NAME HERE>,

Thank you for your interest in the Mobile Quality Engineering role at Manulife. As part of our interview process we would like to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your skills by completing a take-home coding challenge. The purpose of this task is to see how you stack up in terms of testing style, thought process and overall knowledge of patterns and best practices.   

This is your opportunity to set yourself apart from other candidates!   

### OPTION 1: Native App Test Writing

For those candidates who have come from a mobile development background, we encourage you to write the missing tests for a native Android application. Proceed to the following link and follow the instructions: <https://github.com/seyDoggy/QE-Testing-Challenge>    

### OPTION 2: Web Test Writing

We recognize that not all Quality Engineers will have had previous experience writing tests within a native app framework, SDK and IDE. For this reason we offer a second option; using the framework of your choosing, write a functional set of tests that cover some of the basic functionality of <https://www.manulifebank.ca>. Please include no less than 5 unique test cases.   

----

When complete, please share your code back with us, either by attaching a zip or sending us link to download or clone your code. Ensure that we have the instructions required to build and run your code.   

Best of luck and please feel free to ask questions.   

Regards, <YOUR NAME HERE>
